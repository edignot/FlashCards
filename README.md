# Flash Cards - CLI Trivia game

### Abstract :
Flash Cards is the game that interacts with command line. There is deck of cards and each card stores a question, three possible answers and one correct answer. User is asked to select one of tree answers to each question, when there are no cards remaining in the deck - user sees percentage of questions that were correct.

Main idea of writing this game is to practice implementing ES6 classes, writing modular, reusable code that follows SRP and implementing a robust testing suite using TDD.
